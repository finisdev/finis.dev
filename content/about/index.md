FINis.DEV is an effort to build a community around Finance and Development. The Open Source movement is not very
strong in this field, with many proprietary solutions, that limit the exchange of ideas and creativity.

This is just an attempt to spark some light and take a first step towards the creation of such community. All feedback
and input is not only appreciated but also desired. We together should define what direction we want to take.

## Licenses

[Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/licenses).


## Code of Conduct

Diversity is key to build a community that thrives when sharing ideas and knowledge. All projects under the FINis.DEV
umbrella are covered with the Code of Conduct as defined by the 
[Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/)
